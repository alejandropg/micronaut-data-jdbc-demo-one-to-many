# Micronaut Data JDBC, demo ONE-TO-MANY

## Build

Ensures that you have Java 11 or newer installed in your system. If not, you can use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to
install Java. For example:

```shell
sdk install java 11.0.11.hs-adpt 
```

Now to build just run:

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

This will build all the modules and install them in your local repository (by default located in `~/.m2/repository`).
